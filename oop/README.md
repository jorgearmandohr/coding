Object Oriented Programming best practices

## Design Principles

### SOLID

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin.

**S:** Single Responsability Principle
A class should have a single responsability it means a class only needs to be responsible for one job.

**O:** Open-Close Principle
A class should be easly extendible without modifying the class itself.

**L:** Lisksov Substitution Principle
Every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.

**I:** Interface Segregation Principle
A consumer/client should never implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

**D:** Dependency Inversion Principle
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

### KISS

Keep it Simple Stupid. Refers to a way of codig which grants code to be readable and easy undersandable for every member of the team. Alway try to avoid complex coding. Structure the code in order to proritize maintainability rates.

### DRY

Don´t repeat yourself. Refers to a way to avoid duplicated code by writing functionalities that already exists or rewriting existing code.

### YAGNI

You Ain't Gonna Need It. States a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.
